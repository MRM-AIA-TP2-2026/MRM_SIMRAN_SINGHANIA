Task 3: Download a csv file attached and push it into the Github_Task folder

The following steps were used: 
1. On downloading the file it was saved as text file so for converting it back to csv file mv Employee.txt Employee.csv was used.
2. next we moved the csv file to the folder in our working repositary using mv Employee.csv Github_Task/
3. now to add it on our remote repositary we use the command git add Github_Task/Employee.csv
4. After that we commit changes using git commit -m "csv file added"
5. Last step we push the file using git push origin master.
